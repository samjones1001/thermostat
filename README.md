## RPS Challenge
#### Technologies: Javascript, Jasmine, JQuery, Open Weather Map, HTML, CSS 
### Week 5 pair programming challenge for [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com)
[Outline](#outline) | [Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions) 

## Brief
In this challenge, you will build the logic needed to model a simple thermostat.

Specification:

   * Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
   * You can increase the temperature with an up function
   * You can decrease the temperature with a down function
   * The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
   * If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
   * If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
   * Power saving mode is on by default
   * You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
   * You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
    (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)

## Outline
This project required the use of JavaScript and jQuery as well as the Jasmine testing framework, which was a new technology to me.  I spent the bulk of the time on the project working with jQuery and investigating methods for manipulating the DOM.  

## Usage Instructions
* clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/samjones1001/thermostat
$ cd thermostat
```

* run tests
